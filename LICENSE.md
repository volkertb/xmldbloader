# Code from Stack Overflow

Here and there, I have applied code examples from Stack Overflow to this project. In such cases, I have added comments containing the shortened direct "Share" URLs that link to the published answers from which I have taken such code, both for reference and as a means of attribution to comply with the license terms of user-contributed content at Stack Overflow. The parts of the code that I have copied from such answers and examples at Stack Overflow (and other Stack Exchange sites) are licensed as follows:

  * https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/
  * https://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/06/attribution-required/

I would also like to thank the helpful people on Stack Overflow for their invaluable information, which has helped and educated me immensely over the years, not just in this project.
