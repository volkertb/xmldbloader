# What is this?

This is a small command-line tool that can be used easily and quickly load XML DataSet files (as generated by DbUnit) into any database that has available JDBC drivers.

# How to use

## xmldbloader.properties

Once built (see the chapter below), you first need to place a file called xmldbloader.properties in the same directory as from which you are going to launch the tool. Example of a valid properties file, assuming a PostgreSQL database:

    allowEmptyFields = true
	\# IMPORTANT: make sure the JAR file you specify contains a JDBC driver which is compatible with your Java version.
    jdbc.jarpath = /usr/local/lib/postgresql-9.4.1211.jre6.jar
    \# The prefix "jdbc:" is implicit and can be either included or omitted.
	jdbc.url = jdbc:postgresql://localhost/postgres
    jdbc.username = postgres
    jdbc.password = postgres

## Running the tool

TODO: Configure the Maven Shade plugin and/or Launch4J (or something similar) to compile a ready-to-use command-line executable.

You need to pass at least one XML file path or directory (containing at least one XML file) as an argument to the main method for the tool to do its work.
