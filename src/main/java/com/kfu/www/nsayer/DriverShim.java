/**
 * <p>
 * If you're going to do any sort of database activity in Java, you'll probably be using JDBC. Like ODBC before it, JDBC is a great way to insure that your
 * program is free of any ties to the underlying database. Traditionally, the mechanism is that you put the JDBC driver somewhere in the classpath and then
 * use class.forName() to find and load the driver. One problem with this is that it presumes that your driver is in the classpath. This means either
 * packaging the driver in your jar, or having to stick the driver somewhere (probably unpacking it too), or modifying your classpath.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * "But why not use something like URLClassLoader and the overload of class.forName() that lets you specify the ClassLoader?" Because the DriverManager will
 * refuse to use a driver not loaded by the system ClassLoader. Ouch!
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The workaround for this is to create a shim class that implements java.sql.Driver. This shim class will do nothing but call the methods of an instance of a
 * JDBC driver that we loaded dynamically. Something like this:
